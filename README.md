# _T. adelaidensis_ supplementary information for thesis chapters 4, 5 & 6 - Included as Thesis Appendix #3

This repository contains the analysis process for transcript assembly, annotation, and gene expression in kidney tissue of the Australian pygmy bluetongue skink _Tiliqua adelaidensis_.  

Methods are best followed through the document  
## [Full-Workflow.pdf](https://github.com/Carmel-src/T.adelaidensis_SuppInfo/blob/main/Full-Workflow-readthedown_FOR-PDF.pdf)
which outlines the full pipeline and links to script files in the context of each step. This document has bookmarks/an interactive table of contents to navigate chapter sections if downloaded before viewing.

The below folders contain the full script files as they are linked to in each section of the above html walkthrough:

### [Thesis Chapter 4 Supplementary Information](https://github.com/Carmel-src/T.adelaidensis_SuppInfo/tree/main/Chapter%204%20-%20Assembly)
#### De-novo Assembly of Transcripts

This section of the document outlines _de-novo_ assembly of long-read Iso-seq data sequenced from poly-a selected RNA extracted from a single Kidney. These sequences will be used to annotate genes found in kidney tissue of _T. adelaidensis_ and create a set of reference transcripts for gene expression analysis conducted in later chapters.  
This section also outlines _de-novo_ assembly of short-reads sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq and compares these assemblies.  

### [Thesis Chapter 5 Supplementary Information](https://github.com/Carmel-src/T.adelaidensis_SuppInfo/tree/main/Chapter%205%20-%20Annotation)
#### Annotation of Transcripts

This section of the document outlines annotation of transcripts (and isoforms) of the full length long read transcripts as assembled in Chapter 4 supplimentary information.  

### [Thesis Chapter 6 Supplementary Information](https://github.com/Carmel-src/T.adelaidensis_SuppInfo/tree/main/Chapter%206%20-%20Gene%20Expression)
#### Gene Expression Analysis

This section of the document outlines gene expression analysis of the same short-read data presented in Chapter 4 supplementary information, however instead of using _de-novo_ assemblies, cleaned reads were directly aligned to the long read reference produced in chapters 4 and 5 supplementary information.
